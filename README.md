# Whiskey Drop 

This project was created as a part of my Code Institute web development course. The primary reason for creating this site was educational; to teach me about what is possible with Bootstrap. The theme of the website is a whiskey delivery service, so it has a real world practical use. The actual code was provided by Matt Rudge of Code Institute, it is not original.
